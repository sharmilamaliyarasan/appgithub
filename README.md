## Customer Data Analysis (TMI) ##

## Description

This project analyzes customer behavior data to uncover patterns in spending habits, income distribution, and regional trends. Using Python's data science stack (Pandas, Matplotlib, NumPy, Seaborn), it provides actionable insights for business strategy and customer segmentation.

## ðŸ“Œ Conclusion & Insights

From the analysis of Customer Data (TMI), several key insights were observed:

ðŸ”¹ Income vs. Spending Behavior

Customers with higher annual income do not always have a high spending score.

Middle-income customers showed balanced spending patterns, indicating they are a strong target group for marketing campaigns.

ðŸ”¹ Customer Segmentation

Based on spending score and income distribution, we can identify 4 customer segments:

High Income â€“ High Spending â†’ Premium customers, suitable for loyalty programs.

High Income â€“ Low Spending â†’ Potential customers who may need targeted promotions.

Low Income â€“ High Spending â†’ Budget-conscious but active buyers, good for discounts/offers.

Low Income â€“ Low Spending â†’ Least profitable group, can be deprioritized in campaigns.

ðŸ”¹ Regional & City Trends

Certain cities show higher customer activity (more transactions), suggesting they are core business hubs.

Targeting top-performing regions with promotions could increase sales efficiency.

ðŸ”¹ Customer Engagement

Customers with fewer days since last purchase show a higher spending score, meaning recency strongly correlates with spending.

Customers with long gaps since purchase may need re-engagement strategies (emails, offers).

## âœ… Business Takeaway:

This analysis highlights opportunities for customer segmentation, personalized marketing, and retention strategies. By focusing on premium and active spenders while re-engaging inactive customers, businesses can optimize revenue and improve customer lifetime value (CLV).
